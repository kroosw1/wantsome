        Autor : <u>William King</u><br>
        Descriere : <br>
        YOU ARE NOT PREPARED... Illidan Stormrage: one of the most powerful beings ever to walk the<br>
        lands of Azeroth, but also the least understood... Long ago, the night elf sorcerer Illidan<br>
        infiltrated the demonic Burning Legion to ward off its invasion of Azeroth. Instead of hailing him<br>
        as a hero, his own kind branded him the Betrayer. For ten thousand years, he languished in<br> 
        prison vilified, isolated, but never forgetting his purpose. Now the Legion has returned, and<br> 
        there is only one champion who can truly stand against it. Released from his bonds, Illidan<br> 
        prepares for the final confrontation in the alien realm of Outland, gathering an army of<br>
        grotesque fel orcs, serpentine naga, cunning blood elves, and twisted demon hunters to his<br>
        side. Yet as before, he is assailed by those who see his schemes as a cynical quest for power,<br>
        including the night elf Maiev Shadowsong, his former jailor. Warden Shadowsong and her<br>
        Watchers have pursued the Betrayer to Outland to exact retribution for his crimes, and she will<br> 
        not rest until Illidan is in her custody . . . or in his grave.
